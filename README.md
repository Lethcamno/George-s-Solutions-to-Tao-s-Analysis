## Thoughts on the Book and its Exercises
The book can serve as a good first mathematics text for someone who has some basic familiarity with proofs. It is written for people interested in the foundations of Analysis, so look elsewhere if you are uninterested in learning how to derive the rules of arithmetic from the Peano Axioms, or in spending 254 pages before learning anything about differentiation. Those who press on will enjoy Tao's inimitably clear explanations, and an exposition whose every part fits together like clockwork.

As someone who came to mathematics from philosophy, I chose the book because of its endearing commitment to get the student "on the bottom of things" (to paraphrase Donald Knuth), thereby making the conceptual foundations of Analysis, and the axiomatic approach to rigorous mathematics, crystal clear.

For those who want to learn analysis but who are more concerned with applications, [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Analysis-Straightforward-Approach-Binmore/dp/0521288827|Binmore's book]] is good. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Analysis-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/144192941X|Pugh]] is shorter, has lots of geometrical intuition in the form of lots of pretty pictures, and is comparable to Tao in clarity. A demanding book as well, but with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/138srr1/the_most_original_exercise_ive_seen_in_a_long/|unmatchable enthusiasm]].
